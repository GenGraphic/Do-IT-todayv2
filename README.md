#Do-IT-today
It's a complex application for people that want to be on time allways. I made this app manly for my use so i can immplement the things that i would need(like agenda, 
note taking app, calendar). 

One feature that i like is that the user can sign up, and all the data are saved on Database and accesible from other devices, witch is very handy for people that 
work from multiple devices. 

After login user is prompted with the Home screen witch is the Agenda part of the app, and from there he can navigate in the app.
